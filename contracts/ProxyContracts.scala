  /**
   * When repaying the loan

   * For a proxy script, we find the minimal it needs for the contract to work. It
   * shouldnt be too complicated.
   *
   * For this one, we only compare it to the data within the repayment box output/input,
   * we just check if its the right box, and also check if the fund is right. Cause all we're
   * doing is transferring the value from this loan to the box.
   *
   * Therefore these are the things to check:
   * 1. Is it the right fund/repayment box (this includes, project name, description
   * 2. Does the fund exceed what they're supposed to pay back. (do we even need this? Maybe someone might wanna pay back more)
